xserver-xorg-video-nouveau (1:0.0.16+git20100518+4b8f1a0-1) experimental; urgency=low
  
  * This version of xserver-xorg-video-nouveau is linked against a newer
    libdrm-nouveau which breaks the ABI and is not compatible with kernels
    <= 2.6.33.  You need to upgrade the kernel to 2.6.34-rc1 or newer.
